# Unsupported by design

This page lists what `@cplieger/fetch` leaves out on purpose, for a developer wondering whether a missing feature is coming. The library is the request and response envelope only. These are decisions, not a backlog.

| Feature                                     | Reason                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Retries and backoff                         | They belong to the code that dispatches the request. Use [@cplieger/actions](https://github.com/cplieger/actions) or your own retry helper             |
| Idempotency-key or `X-Request-ID` injection | Pass them per request in `headers`, or set them in `prepareHeaders`                                                                                    |
| Interceptor or middleware chains            | `prepareHeaders` sets headers on every request and a custom `fetchFn` can wrap the call itself, so no plugin pipeline is needed                        |
| Decoder combinators                         | The library ships only the `Decoder<T>` type and calls it. Keep your own validators, hand-written or from a library such as zod or valibot             |
| Response caching and revalidation           | This is a request envelope, not a data cache                                                                                                           |
| Changeable or global settings               | Settings are frozen at `createFetch`. A changed backend is a new instance, and state that changes per request is read inside `prepareHeaders`          |
| Non-JSON responses or the raw `Response`    | Responses are read as JSON, with their headers on the result. Call `fetch` directly for a binary or streamed body, `statusText`, `url` or `redirected` |
